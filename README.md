# SWIM2016 Pre-Conference Short Course GitHub Repository

This is the class GitHub repository for the pre-conference workshop taught at the [2016 SWIM-APCAMM meeting](http://www.plevin.com.au/swim2016/index.html).

Pre-Conference Workshop - Groundwater in Coastal Zones - Modelling and measurement.
Tues 28 June-Sat 2 July 2016
Course [link](http://www.groundwater.com.au/events/1109)

The course is organised by the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training and will be held at Rydges Tradewinds Cairns, the venue for SWIM 2016.

Topics will include:
* Theory of variable-density flow and solute transport
* Sharp-interface analytical solutions
* FloPy, a Python tool for the MODFLOW code family
* MODFLOW SWI package
* SEAWAT

## Laptop Requirement
Each course participant is expected to arrive with a laptop computer that has the required software installed and tested according to the instructions presented here.  Laptop computers should be running a standard installation of either the Windows or Macintosh operating systems. Users should arrive with privileged account access, sometimes called a “PR account”, in the event that additional software installation is required.  Please coordinate with your IT group prior to arriving to the class.

## Software Requirements
We ask that you install and test the following software prior to showing up for the class.  Installers are located on a public ftp site.  A separate email was sent with instructions about software installation.  Please use the provided installers so that everyone is using the same version.

## Internet Availability
The classroom will have wireless Internet.  Those requiring access to the specific domains will need to establish a VPN connection.

## Exercises/Notebooks
Many of the beginning Python concepts will be taught using the Jupyter Notebook, which runs Python from a web browser.  We will also be running Python scripts using the command line and several other approaches.  

## Python Tutorial
For those with little or no Python experience, we request that you complete the online tutorial at Code Academy:
